### Notes

This marks the first official release of Image Occlusion Enhanced for Anki 2.1! Porting the add-on to Anki 2.1 has been [an arduous journey](https://github.com/glutanimate/image-occlusion-enhanced/projects/1), but I'm happy we're finally here. 

Before we dive into the actual changelog I would just like to thank each and everyone of you who has helped in this effort, either by [contributing to the codebase](https://github.com/glutanimate/image-occlusion-enhanced/graphs/contributors), filing [bug reports](https://github.com/glutanimate/image-occlusion-enhanced/issues), or by supporting my work directly through [tips](https://glutanimate.com/tip-jar/), [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/glutanimate), or add-on commissions!

In particular I would like to thank the following awesome people who support me on Patreon / have supported me at some point during the development of Image Occlusion Enhanced for Anki 2.1:

- Blacky 372
- SebastiÃ¡n Ortega
- Edan Maor
- Peter Benisch

**Important**: This is an Anki 2.1-only release (for now)

### Added

The primary focus in this release was Anki 2.1 compatibility, but v1.3.0 also comes with a number of nifty **new features** which I would like to highlight first:

- You can now **occlude images in any note type you want**, either by **right clicking** on them and selecting the respective option, or by using the Image Occlusion button!
- As an added bonus: The new context menu introduced by the add-on will also allow you to **open any image with your default system viewer** â€“ a great way to perform quick image editing tasks when needed.
- The masks editor now allows you to **add hints to your occlusion shapes**. In order to do so, simply create a text element on top of a shape and group it with the shape.
- You can now set a **custom hotkey** for invoking I/O. Gone are the days of conflicts with different keyboard locales!
- In-app **help screens** now guide users through the basic use of the add-on (including how to add cards, edit them, group masks, label items, etc.)

(Some of the changes above will likely also be part of a future release of v1.3.0 for Anki 2.0.)

### Fixed

v1.3.0 for Anki 2.1 also comes with a plethora of **bug fixes** (some of the bugs fixed in this update have plagued I/O ever since its original release!):

- Fix: Automatically remove accidentally drawn shapes. This addresses instances where users would end up with more cards than they should have because of invisible shapes drawn by the oversensitive editor component (especially with touch interfaces)
- Fix: Resolve issues with unicode characters in Anki path and/or image path. This should fix most of the problems users were experiencing with non-latin locales (e.g. the I/O editor screen remaining blank because SVG-Edit did not load, or various UnicodeError messages)
- Fix: More robust I/O editor instantiation. Should help address some of the stability issues users experienced over longer card creation sessions (e.g. needing to restart Anki to get I/O working again).
- and a large number of other smaller bug fixes and improvements

### Changes

There also some **changes to the workflow** in I/O v1.3.0 that you need to be aware of:

- The default hotkey for invoking I/O is now Ctrl+Shift+O (customizable through the new settings entry)
- The card generation options have been renamed and simplified: You can now choose between "Hide All, Guess One" (used to be "Hide All, Reveal One") and "Hide One, Guess One" (used to be "Hide All, Reveal All"). My hope with these new names is that they will be more intuitive for new users. (thanks a lot to Tiago Barroso for the suggestion!)
- "Hide All, Reveal All" is no longer available as a mask generation option. With the mask reveal button introduced in recent I/O releases it no longer served much of a purpose and was mostly confusing new users as they expected it to work like a grouped occlusion of all shapes.

    Just in case you were using this option and are now wondering how to cover the same use cases:
        
    + In case you were using "Hide All, Reveal All" to uncover all labels on the back: Try to switch to using "Hide One, Guess One" coupled with the mask reveal button on the backside (hotkey: `G`)
    + In case you were using "Hide All, Reveal All" to 'group' your shapes: Use the [actual grouping feature](https://github.com/glutanimate/image-occlusion-enhanced/wiki/Advanced-Use#grouping-items) instead

### Limitations

There are a number of known limitations to this alpha release that you need to be aware of:

- Due to compatibility issues between SVG-Edit and the new Chromium renderer in Anki 2.1 some of the features in the masks editor no longer work correctly. My hope is to address these in the following beta release:
    + [Pointer not changing to selection mode when clicking on shape](https://github.com/glutanimate/image-occlusion-enhanced/issues/54)
    + [Path tool no longer working](https://github.com/glutanimate/image-occlusion-enhanced/issues/56)
    + [https://github.com/glutanimate/image-occlusion-enhanced/issues/57](https://github.com/glutanimate/image-occlusion-enhanced/issues/57)
- Please do not invoke the add-on's settings menu while the I/O Editor is running. There is currently no support for updating I/O editing sessions at runtime, and while most settings will simply only not be applied, others might cause the add-on to stop working correctly until the editor session is restarted. The same applies to modifications to the add-on's note type via Anki's built-in note type manager.

Of course there also bound to be some unforeseen bugs and regressions in the alpha. If you experience any of these please make sure to either report them on the add-on's [bug tracker](https://github.com/glutanimate/image-occlusion-enhanced/issues) or in the [official support thread](https://anki.tenderapp.com/discussions/add-ons/8295-image-occlusion-enhanced-official-thread). 
    
## [1.2.2] - 2017-04-04

## [1.2.0] - 2017-02-14

- **New**: Reuse existing images when creating multiple occlusion sets from the same base image

### Changed

- Changed: Updated default field order to move the question mask below the original image. Should make it easier to identify each respective card in the browser.

### Fixed

- Fixed: Remove card margins on mobile devices
- Fixed: Increased size of mask toggle button on mobile devices

### Notes

Please note that the changes to the field order and card templates only apply to new installations of the add-on. I've decided against enforcing these changes on existing installations as that would undo any customizations you might have applied to the note type. If you'd like to update your cards with these changes, please follow [the instructions in the Wiki](https://github.com/Glutanimate/image-occlusion-enhanced/wiki/Troubleshooting#resetting-note-type-and-template-to-the-defaults) to reset your field order and card template to the (new) defaults.

The most comprehensive update to _Image Occlusion Enhanced_ since its inception:

### Added

- **Modify Existing Notes**
  - Need to remove or add a shape, update a field, or resize all masks? Now you can!
- **Change Images on the Fly**
  - Simply switch to a different image to occlude right from the IO Editor
- **New Occlusion Mode**
  - Hides all labels on the question side, and reveals all of them on the back
  - The different occlusion modes now also follow a new naming scheme. It should be self-explanatory what each of them does, but you can hover over the respective button to get a more detailed description
- **Completely Reworked Note Type**
  - 4 additional fields to give your notes enough space for all the extra information they might need
  - New intuitive field order, with the Header and Image right on top. No more issues identifying your notes in the Browser!
- **Full Customization**
  - You can now add as many fields to the note type as you like
  - New Options entry for renaming default fields

### Changed

- **Updated Options Interface**
  - More options, fewer bugs
- **Fully Rewritten Note Generator**
  - Faster, more extensible, and less bug-prone
- **Performance Improvements**
  - Smaller memory footprint in general use (by about 30MB)

### Fixed

- **Stability Improvements**
  - Bug fixes everywhere

    
## [1.0.0-beta6] - 2016-11-07

### Added

- **New**: Use a button instead of clicking the image to reveal all masks. The old method interfered with gesture support on mobile clients.
- **New**: Default action hotkey (Ctrl+Return)

### Changed

- **Other**: Set Extra fields to be note-specific by default

## [1.0.0-beta5] - 2016-11-05

### Added

- **New**: Reveal all occluded areas when clicking image on answer side â€“ This is a somewhat of an experimental change as there's no official support for JavaScript in Anki. Note: Normally this would require an update to the IO note type, but given that this is an experimental change I decided not to force the update. Instead, feel free to test this new feature on an empty Anki profile.

### Fixed

- **Fix**: Force media sync when updating mask files
- **Fix**: Handle deleted IO note type more graciously

### Changed

- **Other**: Updated tooltips for occlusion types (@dgbeecher)

    
## [1.0.0-beta4] - 2016-10-18

### Changed

- Updated the default card template
  - The new template includes the two new extra fields and uses a more elaborate layout for all sections below the image. It also provides much needed adjustments of the styling for AnkiMobile and AnkiDroid
  - **Important**: This will overwrite any previous changes to the card templates you might have performed. If you've used a previous Beta and customized your template or styles please make sure to back them up before installing this version.
  - FWIW, drastic changes like this will only happen with Beta releases. If I ever see the need to change the template for a stable update I will implement it in a way that asks you for confirmation first.

### Fixed

- Fixed a number of smaller issues (thanks to @dgbeecher for reporting these!)

    
## [1.0.0-beta3] - 2016-10-15

### Added

- New options for labels and lines
- New option for ignoring fields when editing
- New error dialog that provides a help button

### Changed

- More verbose tooltips when generating notes

### Fixed

- Line color and width should now be preserved when switching to a different tool
- Lots of smaller bug fixes


## [1.0.0-beta2] - 2016-10-13

### Fixed

- Possible fix for a module import error on macOS

## [1.0.0-beta1] - 2016-10-12
